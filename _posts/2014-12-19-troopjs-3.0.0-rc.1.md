Today we released [3.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc.1), __our first release-candidate__! As we're closing in on the final release we're working hard on getting the tests/packaging/documentation into good shape so you won't see much change in functionality.

**Important** The biggest impact on existing applications for this release would be the changes to the runners and some minor changes in package names. We don't believe there are any 3.x applications out there that would be impacted, but as always upgrade with care.
