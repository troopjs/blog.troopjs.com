Today we released [3.0.0-pr.6](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-pr.6).

As usual the easies way to try it out is to clone [troopjs-widget-quickstart](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/) and start from there, or if you want to start from a clean repo just install [troopjs-widget](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget) via bower.

{% highlight bash %}
bower install troopjs-widget#^1
{% endhighlight %}

At the moment the preview releases are being pushed out in a rather fast pace as we are in the process of writing a compatibility layer for <a href="http://ef.com">EF</a> applications written in TroopJS 2.x so they can seamlessly upgrade to TroopJS 3.x (ps, if there's community interest we could probably open that to the public, but for now it's just internal).

Go get your troop on!
