Today we released [3.0.0-pr.9](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-pr.9), and _hopefully_ __this is our last preview release before going release-candidate__!

As usual the easies way to try it out is to clone [troopjs-widget-quickstart](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/) and start from there, or if you want to start from a clean repo just install [troopjs-widget](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget) via bower.

{% highlight bash %}
bower install troopjs-widget#^1
{% endhighlight %}

**Important** The biggest change in this release is the removal of `pragmas` for 2.x apps (`hub:memory/topic` and `dom:.selector/event`), dropping the legacy API's (`.subscribe`, `.unsubscribe`, `.publish` etc.) and not pushing `task` events on the `dom` or `hub` by default. This could totally break your applications, make sure it doesn't.
