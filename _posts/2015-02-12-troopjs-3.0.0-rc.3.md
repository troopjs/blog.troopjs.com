Today we released [3.0.0-rc.3](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc.3). This release only contains one change - making [mu-emitter](https://github.com/mu-lib/mu-emitter) the base emitter for the troop emitter.

This may not look like a big change (and really, it should not as we are currently in our RC cycle) but we feel it was an important enough change to warrant a new RC release.

Part of the refactoring included moving some classes around as well as some simple method renaming, most notably:

 - `core/event/emitter` - `core/emitter/composition`
 - `runner.run` - `executor.execute`
