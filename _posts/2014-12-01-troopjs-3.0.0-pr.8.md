Today we released [3.0.0-pr.8](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-pr.8).

As usual the easies way to try it out is to clone [troopjs-widget-quickstart](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/) and start from there, or if you want to start from a clean repo just install [troopjs-widget](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget) via bower.

{% highlight bash %}
bower install troopjs-widget#^1
{% endhighlight %}

**Important** We released `troopjs-widget#1.0.0-pr.5` that contains important fixes for widget finalization in parallel with this release. Make sure to upgrade your projects.
{: .notice}

This release only contained on fix related to render, but still worth an update.
