Today we released [3.0.0-pr.7](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-pr.7).

As usual the easies way to try it out is to clone [troopjs-widget-quickstart](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/) and start from there, or if you want to start from a clean repo just install [troopjs-widget](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget) via bower.

{% highlight bash %}
bower install troopjs-widget#^1
{% endhighlight %}

This release comes with changes that allow you to reconfigure framework signals and a way to conditionally rewrite method names based on spec in compose (this was needed for our internal -compat layer).

Grab it, try it, use it!
