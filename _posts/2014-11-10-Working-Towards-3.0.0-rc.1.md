Over the last few months we've been working hard on the upcoming [3.0.0](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/milestones/3.0.0) release. The last release was [3.0.0-pr.2+fa7fcdb](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-pr.2%2Bfa7fcdb) wich was published June 10th.

A lot has changed since then.

We'll be publishing a series of blog posts here explaining the (major) changes done in 3.x over 2.x, the architectual changes, the new and deprecated functionality, basically all the fun stuff.
