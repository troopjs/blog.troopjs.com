One of the questions we get asked a lot is

> What is the absolute smallest production ready project that uses TroopJS?

and up until now we've always had to create one from scratch each time someone asked.

But now we've created [troopjs-widget-quickstart](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/) that you can clone and have a skeleton to build your app on, try it out!
