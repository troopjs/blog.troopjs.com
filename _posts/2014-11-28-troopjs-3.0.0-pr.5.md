Today we released [3.0.0-pr.5](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-pr.5).

The easies way to try it out is to clone [troopjs-widget-quickstart](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/) and start from there, or if you want to start from a clean repo just install [troopjs-widget](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget) via bower.

{% highlight bash %}
bower install troopjs-widget#^1
{% endhighlight %}

If you are looking for the docs you can access them [online](https://cdn.rawgit.com/troopjs/troopjs/3.0.0-pr.5/docs/index.html) or download them from the [releases archive](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/releases/tag/3.0.0-pr.5).
