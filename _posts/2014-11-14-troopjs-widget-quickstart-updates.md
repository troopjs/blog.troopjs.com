We've updated the [troopjs-widget-quickstart](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/) with sane defaults for packaging your app into a bundle and we've event included a [readme](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/blob/develop/README.md) to get you up and running quickly.

Try it out and file an [issue](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-widget-quickstart/issues) if you think something is missing or needs to be fixed.
